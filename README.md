### To run the app
Run npm start to start both the backend server and the frontend on expo - you might have to run it from the cmd window but it must be located in the app (i.e. EpilepsyApp).

### To get it on your phone
install an app called Expo (expo go on andriod). Then you scan the QR code which is either printed on your cmd terminal or on your local host which should automatically load when you start the app. This will then show the app on your phone!
