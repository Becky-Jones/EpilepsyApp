### Install react native app
npm install -g react-native-app

### Install react native cli and expo cli
npm install -g react-native-cli
npm install -g expo-cli

### To run the app
Either
npm start OR expo start 

TIP: npm start didn't work properly for me however expo start did - you might have to run it from the cmd window but it must be located in the app (i.e. EpilepsyApp/epilepsy-app).

### To get it on your phone
install an app called Expo (expo go on andriod). Then you scan the QR code which is either printed on your cmd terminal or on your local host which should automatically load when you start the app. This will then show the app on your phone! The writing you see is located in the App.js file
